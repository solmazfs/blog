My Journey So Far...


**Mar 31, 2024**: I quit working at the factory.

**Jan 20, 2023**: I started to work on factory.

**Apr 5, 2022**: I applied for a lecturer position for the first time. My application was accepted, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to take the exam.

**Mar 28, 2022**: My YÖKDİL (Social Sciences) exam result came in at **65**. This exam proved tougher than I expected, highlighting the need for more focused study on advanced vocabulary.

**Dec 7, 2021**: Finally! I passed the ALES (Verbal) exam with a score of **72.8**. What a relief!
